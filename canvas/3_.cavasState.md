## the canvas state

- each context keeps its own drawing state
- you can save the current state and restore a previous one
- a state can be pushed into a stack of saved states

> Each time you save a drawing state, it goes on a stack and then when you > restore it, the one that is on top of stack gets popped off and becomes 
> the current drawing state.

- canvas state keeps track of properties like:
      
      1.current values:
                  * lineWidth
                  * strokeStyle
                  * fillStyle
                  * lineCap etc
      
      2.current transformation matrix
      
      3.current clipping region     
      

### to save and restore state => ***save()*** and ***restore()****  

- 1 call context.save()
- 2 perform a normal set of drawing ops to change state
- 3 call context.restore()
