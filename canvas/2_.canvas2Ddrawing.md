## canvas 2D Drawing API

- to draw in canvas, you'll need the 2D drawing Api

### 3-step to drawing

i. Â  get a reference to the canvas element .    
ii.  get the drawing context from the element using:     
     ex:
         getContext()
iii. if result of getContext() is not null, draw away!    



### canvas 2D Drawing Api is broken down into 3 groups:

1. first group deals with ***shapes***: rect,lines,texts, arcs, paths and styles

2. second group deals with ***how things are drawn***
   patterns, gradients, shadows, clipping paths
   
3. third group are: transforms, images, video and raw pixels   


### drawing techniques

- fillStyle   => to use when filling css color, gradient, pattern(defaults:black)
- strokeStyle => to use on strokes css color, gradient, pattern (defaults:black)
- lineWidth   => width of the imaginary pen to use when drawing lines (defaults 1)


### drawing shapes basics

### rectangles
- this is canvas only primitive shape supported by canvas

- functions:

> coords, width and height
   
   * clearRect(x,y,w,h)  => erases existing rectangle, makes the are fully  
                            transparent
   
   * strokeRect(x,y,w,h) => outlines a rectangle with the current strokeStyle
   
   * fillRect(x,y,w,h)   => fills a given rectangle with the current fillStyle
   
   
### lines
- lines can be created in several ways

- attributes/ functions

   * moveTo(x,y) => moves the imaginary pen to the given coordinates 
                    but it doesn't draw anything
                    
   * lineTo(x,y) => draws a line from pen current position to new point
   
   //how the line looks on screen
   * lineWidth   => determines pixel width
   * lineCap     => line endings: butt(default), round, square 
   * lineJoin    => how lines join together: round, bevel
   
   * beginPath() => begins a new set of drawing ops
   * stroke()    => collects all of the current path commands and draws them.
