## canvas 2D Drawing API

- to draw in canvas, you'll need the 2D drawing Api

### 3-step to drawing &nbsp; :monkey:

i.   get a reference to the canvas element .    
ii. &nbsp;get the drawing context from the element using:     
```   
       Ex:
       getContext()   
```       

iii.&nbsp; if result of getContext() is not null, draw away!       



### canvas 2D Drawing Api is broken down into 3 groups:

1. first group deals with ***shapes***: rect,lines,texts, arcs, paths and styles

2. second group deals with ***how things are drawn***
   patterns, gradients, shadows, clipping paths
   
3. third group are: transforms, images, video and raw pixels   


### drawing techniques

- <kbd>fillStyle</kbd>   => to use when filling css color, gradient, pattern(defaults:black)
- <kbd>strokeStyle</kbd> => to use on strokes css color, gradient, pattern (defaults:black)
- <kbd>lineWidth</kbd>   => width of the imaginary pen to use when drawing lines (defaults 1)


### drawing shapes basics

#### rectangles
- this is ***canvas only primitive shape*** supported by canvas

___functions___:

> coords, width and height
   
-  <kbd>clearRect(x,y,w,h)</kbd>  => erases existing rectangle, makes the are fully transparent . 
     
- <kbd>strokeRect(x,y,w,h)</kbd> => outlines a rectangle with the current strokeStyle
   
- <kbd>fillRect(x,y,w,h)</kbd>   => fills a given rectangle with the current fillStyle
   
   
#### lines
- lines can be created in several ways

___attributes/ functions___


- <kbd>moveTo(x,y)</kbd> => moves the imaginary pen to the given coordinates but it doesn't draw anything . 
                      
- <kbd>lineTo(x,y)</kbd> => draws a line from pen current position to new point
   
___how the line looks on screen___

* <kbd>lineWidth</kbd>   => determines pixel width
* <kbd>lineCap</kbd>     => line endings: butt(default), round, square 
* <kbd>lineJoin</kbd>    => how lines join together: round, bevel
   
* <kbd>beginPath()</kbd> => begins a new set of drawing ops
* <kbd>stroke()</kbd>    => collects all of the current path commands and draws them.
