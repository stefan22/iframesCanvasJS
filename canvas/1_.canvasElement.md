## canvas element
- provides web pages with a drawing surface..for drawing:    
  graphics, shapes, images, text, etc

- supported in all latest browsers: IE9+, Chrome3+, Safari3+, Firefox3+

- pages can have more than one canvas and overlap
- canvas contents are created on-the-fly using script
- once they're drawn, they're forgotten by the script engine.
- canvas is good for dynamic visual media, but contents are not part of the   
  page.
- for things that you want to manipulate later using js, you'll use svg


## canvas tag
- the canvas coordinate system starts at the upper left, with increasing
  values of ***X*** going left to right, and increasing values of ***Y*** from
  top to bottom
- canvas element start out invisible
  

 ``` 
           x
      y    ---------->
      |    _______________
      |   |(0,0)          |
      |   |               |  
      â€¢   |  width,height |
          |_______________| 
         
 ```     
 
 - canvas declared w/word canvas -->  ***<canvas>***
 
 ex:
 
 ```
      <canvas id="canvasa1" width="400" height="300">
         Fall content if needed support for IE < 9 (not)
      </canvas>
 
 ```
 
 
### canvas attributes:
---------------------
 
 * width - defaults to 300px (can be set or retrieved)
 * height - defaults to 150px (it can be set or retrieved)
 
### canvas methods:
-------------------
 * toDataURL(type) - converts contents of canvas(image) to a static image(
   image/png) - (data://)   
   It takes the png image and gives you a 64bit encoded data url
 
 * getContext(ctxID) -get the drawing context for the canvas
 
 * getContext() -one of most importants
   
   * it retrieves the drawing context from canvas
   * the context has all of the information about the canvas, all drawing   
     methods and code
     
 
 
### canvas and svg (scalable vector graphic)

>  svg is another way of drawing into web pages - is similar to canvas but 
>  works a bit differently

- with ***canvas*** you draw directly in canvas surface
- in ***svg***, the elements are part of the DOM
- ***canvas*** draws with pixels, ***svg*** uses vectors
- ***canvas*** animations are not built-in, in ***svg*** animations are
- ***canvas*** gives you better performance cause it can take advantage of your 
  computers GPU(graphics processing unit) while ***svg*** uses xml  

> you can also use both together in the same page
