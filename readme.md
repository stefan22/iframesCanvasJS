## canvas element

- provides web pages with a drawing surface..for drawing:    
  graphics, shapes, images, text, etc

- supported in all latest browsers: IE9+, Chrome3+, Safari3+, Firefox3+

- pages can have more than one canvas and overlap
- canvas contents are created on-the-fly using script
- once they're drawn, they're forgotten by the script engine.
- canvas is good for dynamic visual media, but contents are not part of the   
  page.
- for things that you want to manipulate later using js, you'll use svg


## canvas tag

- the canvas coordinate system starts at the upper left, with increasing
  values of ***X*** going left to right, and increasing values of ***Y*** from
  top to bottom
- canvas element start out invisible

- using more css attrs than iframes attrs
- scrollbars will appear automatically if needed
- use js to set height to remove them

```
   iframe {
       border:1px solid #ccc;
       width:80%; height:120px;
   }

```
